# BigBot
An open implementation of Pluribus

This is my attempt to replicate Facebook's [Pluribus poker bot](https://ai.meta.com/blog/pluribus-first-ai-to-beat-pros-in-6-player-poker/) for Heads-Up No Limit Texas Hold'em. I'm assuming it'll be a large and complex endevour, and so this will probably be split up into multiple sections.

The overall architecture can be seen below:
