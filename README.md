# BigBot
An open source implementation of Pluribus

This is my attempt to replicate Facebook's [Pluribus poker bot](https://ai.meta.com/blog/pluribus-first-ai-to-beat-pros-in-6-player-poker/) for Heads-Up No Limit Texas Hold'em. I'm assuming it'll be a large and complex endevour, and so this will probably be split up into multiple sections.

The overall architecture can be seen below or [found here on draw.io](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QXuASrp50TTdOvcm1UAAe4BbRwa0L5-8/view?usp=sharing):

I'll eventually write this in C++ for performance and for the available resources to help, I'm not sure if I'll prototype in python before though. 

My current objectives are listed in the TODO file.

NOTE: Before using this code for commercial purposes (i.e. making money), you must get my (@DanielMillward) permission first!
