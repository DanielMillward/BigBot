- !!! rearrange flowchart since blueprint generator isn't a dependency of the other stuff
- Write pseudocode for blueprint generator
- Write pseudocode for real time searcher
- General flow for components, top down, back to front


General Flow reference:
1. Write first/second level pseudocode for part, assuming it'll be a DLL
2. Make list of objects, their inputs/outputs, and their purposes
3. List unit tests for the objects
4. Write tests for the component as a whole
5. Do TDD and actually write the darn thing
